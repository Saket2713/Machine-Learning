# Machine Learning Algorithms in Python

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. The purpose of this repository is to provide simple, easy-to-understand implementations of various machine learning techniques for both supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Overview

This project covers several core areas of machine learning, including:

- **Classification:** Predict categorical outcomes using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Regression:** Predict continuous values with Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Ridge Regression.
- **Clustering:** Group data points into clusters using algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Other Models:** Dimensionality reduction using PCA, and instance-based learning using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive code examples** for each algorithm, with comments explaining each step.
- **Sample datasets** included for testing and experimentation.
- **Visualizations** to illustrate the results and performance of the algorithms.
